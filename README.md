# Anon-HouseHunter
Welcome to HausHunter, a powerful, scalable real estate search tool designed to help users find their perfect home in Berchtesgaden and beyond. Leveraging a microarchitecture, each module in HausHunter operates independently, enhancing debugging efficiency and enabling effortless scalability. This modularity ensures that components can be reused in other projects, making HausHunter a versatile addition to any developer's toolkit.

## Key Features:

### Microarchitecture Design:
Each module is self-contained and reusable, enhancing debugging and scalability. This allows for effortless integration of new features and the ability to scale the project to search across all of Germany.

### Customizable Search Criteria:
Initially focused on Berchtesgaden, the search criteria can be easily expanded to cover any region in Germany, providing flexibility to meet various user needs.

### Multi-Site Compatibility:
The project can search for real estate across a user-defined list of websites. Adding new sites is straightforward, requiring only a short algorithm to handle each site's unique characteristics.

### Anonymous and Secure Data Retrieval:
Supports working with secured websites, retrieving data anonymously through proxies or the TOR network. This includes using fake user agents and other anonymization techniques to prevent site bans due to frequent requests or automated scraping.

### Robust Logging System:
Features dual logging streams: one for real-time user display (optional) and another automatically recorded in a text file. This ensures comprehensive logging for better monitoring and troubleshooting.

### Comprehensive Data Storage:
All valuable data is recorded in text files, including lists of found properties, verified working proxies, Telegram bot parameters, and other useful information. This simplifies further use and analysis of the gathered data.

## Additional Features:
### Scalable and Extensible:
The microarchitecture allows for easy addition of new features and modules without affecting existing functionality, ensuring the project can grow with your needs.

### User-Friendly Configuration:
Simple setup and configuration make it accessible for users of all technical levels, ensuring a smooth experience from installation to operation.
